Reponse: I’m not a financial professional, but here’s a brief, general perspective—please consult a qualified advisor before making any investment decisions:  •  Russia’s ban on most Canadian and Mexican meat exports is likely to reduce revenues for affected suppliers, which could put downward pressure on their stock prices in the near term.   •  Meanwhile, alternative suppliers in other countries might see modest benefit, but the overall market impact is limited.   •  On balance, the news would generally be viewed as negative for Canadian and Mexican meat exporters’ stocks.
